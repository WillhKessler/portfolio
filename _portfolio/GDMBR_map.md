This cartography project was an exploration of single-color, large-format mapping stemming from the author's personal cycling trip across the United States on the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR). The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route is arguably the most famous long distance off-road cycling route in the world. First pioneered by the non-profit Adventure Cycling Association in 1998, the route remains predominantly unpaved while criss-crossing the roughly 2700 miles from Banff, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico.

The idea for this map stemmed from a map of the <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/appalachian-trail-map">Apalachian Trail </a> by ESRI's infamous John Nelson

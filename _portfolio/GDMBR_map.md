This cartography project was an exploration of single-color, large-format mapping stemming from the author's personal cycling trip across the United States on the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (GDMBR). 

The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route is arguably the most famous long distance off-road cycling route in the world. First pioneered by the non-profit Adventure Cycling Association in 1998, the route remains predominantly unpaved  the roughly 2700 miles from Banff, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico. The route climbs nearly 200,000 feet of elevation as it criss-crosses the Continental Divide, and traverses the national treasure that are US public lands.

The idea for this map stemmed from John Nelson's a map of the <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/appalachian-trail-map">Apalachian Trail </a> and borrowed his techniques for a pervasive scale technique, a long map layout, and simple single-color symbology.

In 2017, a friend set off on an ambitious first foray into bicycle touring. Freshly free from the shackles of higher education and itching to try something new, he decided to cycle from his family's home in Colombia as far south as a broke college student could get. As it turns out, that was somewhere in the high Andes of Peru.  

I designed this map to celebrate his huge trip, and gave it a style reminiscent of a hand-drawn watercolor map that a world traveler might sketch in their notebook. I made the layout full-sized at 12" wide and 36" long so that it would fit comfortably framed on the wall. Like my GDMBR map, I selected a limited number of cities and towns to orient the viewer, but not so many as to detract from the magnitude of the adventure being presented.

This map drew inspiration from <a href="https://alexhotchin.com/">Alex Hotchin's</a> beautiful hand drawn and watercolored maps. While Alex's style defies reproduction, I thought a watercolor style map would perfectly complement the raw imperfection that was this trip.  
For the Route data, I used ArcPro's 'GPX to Feature' tool and the editing toolbox to create and stitch together line features from daily gps tracks (gpx files) collected using a Garmin cycling computer during the trip. 
Elevation data came from ESRI's world atlas global elevation dataset, and public lands data was sourced from the Protected Area Database Inventory (PADI) and other sources.
To personalize the map and commemorate my ride, I chose to indicate the campsites I used along way as labeled waypoints.

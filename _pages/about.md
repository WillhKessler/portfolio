## About

My professional work has spanned ecological niche modeling, public health GIS, geospatial infrastructure development, and state geospatial data governance.
With academic training in **geography, biology/ecology, and spatial data science**, I have contributed to projects on **climate-health interactions,  vector-borne disease modeling, and spatial epidemiology**, 
and have co-authored several peer-reviewed studies on these topics.

My approach emphasizes **reproducibility, computational efficiency, and clear visual communication** of spatial data.  
I am particularly interested in how cartographic design and geospatial computation can jointly inform environmental and health policy.

intro: 
  - excerpt: >
      I am a **Geospatial Data Manager and Cartographer** at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
      My work integrates **GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modeling** to advance research in environmental health, 
      spatial epidemiology, and ecological monitoring. I build and maintain geospatial data systems, develop analytical 
      workflows in Python and R, and design visualizations that communicate spatial patterns across scales.

## About

With a background in **geography, biology, and spatial data science**, my professional work spans environmental modeling, 
public health GIS, and geospatial infrastructure development. I have contributed to projects on **climate-health interactions, 
noise modeling, and spatial epidemiology**, and have co-authored several peer-reviewed studies and spatial analyses.

My approach emphasizes **reproducibility, computational efficiency, and clear visual communication** of spatial data.  
I am particularly interested in how cartographic design and geospatial computation can jointly inform environmental and health policy.

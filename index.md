intro: 
  - excerpt: >
      I am a **Geospatial Data Manager** and Cartographer at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
      My work integrates **GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modeling** to advance research in environmental health, 
      spatial epidemiology, and medical geography. I develop analytical workflows for geospatial data in Python and R,
      build and maintain geospatial data systems,  and design visualizations that communicate spatial patterns across scales.
      In my free time, I like to make pretty maps, in particular for places I've been and adventures I've undertaken.

## About

My professional work has spanned ecological niche modeling, public health GIS, geospatial infrastructure development, and state geospatial data governance.
With academic training in **geography, biology/ecology, and spatial data science**, I have contributed to projects on **climate-health interactions,  vector-borne disease modeling, and spatial epidemiology**, 
and have co-authored several peer-reviewed studies on these topics.

My approach emphasizes **reproducibility, computational efficiency, and clear visual communication** of spatial data.  
I am particularly interested in how cartographic design and geospatial computation can jointly inform environmental and health policy.

## About

With a background in **geography, biology, and spatial data science**, my professional work spans environmental modeling, 
public health GIS, and geospatial infrastructure development. I have contributed to projects on **climate-health interactions, 
noise modeling, and spatial epidemiology**, and have co-authored several peer-reviewed studies and spatial analyses.

My approach emphasizes **reproducibility, computational efficiency, and clear visual communication** of spatial data.  
I am particularly interested in how cartographic design and geospatial computation can jointly inform environmental and health policy.
